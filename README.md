Slides and example from "Build Your Own Programming Language"
======================================================

This is the example language grammar used during my JSConf Track B presentation. `example.mylang` shows an example of the language we want to parse.

To regenerate the parser, copy and paste the grammar into the [Jison online generator](http://jison.org/try/) and download the generated parser to save it to disk, or you can experiment right in the browser.
