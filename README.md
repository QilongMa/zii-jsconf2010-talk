"Build Your Own Programming Language with JavaScript" slides and code
==========================================

* `example.mylang` shows an example of the language we want to parse
* `grammar.jison` is the grammar describing the parsing and AST building rules of the language
* `codegen.js` is the script that translate the AST into our target language. I forgot to emphasis that you don't have to generate JavaScript. Your target language could be whatever you desire.
* `jsconf2010.pdf` are the slides from the talk.
* `parser.js` generated parser.

Use the [Jison online generator](http://jison.org/try/) to play with the language and generate parsers.
